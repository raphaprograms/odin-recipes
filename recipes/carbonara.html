    <h2>Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
    <p>We throw tradition to the wind with our speedy spaghetti carbonara recipe, with some sneaky shortcuts for time-poor cooks. It may taste exactly like the real deal, but this carbonara sauce has some secrets behind its glossy surface, proving some rules are just begging to be broken.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>400g spaghetti</ul>
        <ul>1 tbsp olive oil</ul>
        <ul>200g sliced Primo Gourmet Selection Pancetta, cut into 1cm-wide strips</ul>
        <ul>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</ul>
        <ul>3 Coles Australian Free Range Eggs, plus 1 extra yolk</ul>
        <ul>1 egg yolk, extra</ul>
        <ul>100ml thickened cream</ul>
        <ul>2/3 cup (50g) freshly grated parmesan</ul>
        <ul>2 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves</ul>
        <ul>parmesan, extra, to serve</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>Cook pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions. Meanwhile, heat oil in a frypan over medium heat. Cook pancetta, stirring, for 2-3 minutes until beginning to crisp. Add garlic for 30 seconds, then set pan aside.</ol>
        <ol>Place eggs and extra egg yolk, cream and parmesan in a bowl. Season, then mix gently with a fork. Drain pasta, then return to pan. Quickly add egg and pancetta mixtures and parsley. Toss to combine - the heat from the pasta will cook the egg slightly and form a creamy sauce. Serve immediately with extra parmesan.</ol>
